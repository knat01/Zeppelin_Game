3D Hierarchical Zeppelin Battle Game
Overview
This repository contains the code for a 3D Hierarchical Zeppelin Battle Game developed using OpenGL and GLUT. The game features a dynamic and interactive 3D environment where players control a zeppelin to navigate through the world, engage in combat with an enemy zeppelin, and avoid incoming fire.

Features
Dynamic 3D Environment: Explore a richly detailed 3D world with a ground mesh and sky.
Zeppelin Control: Players can control the movement of their zeppelin in all directions using keyboard inputs.
Combat Mechanics: Engage in battles with an enemy zeppelin. The game includes shooting mechanics and collision detection.
First-Person View (FPV): Toggle between first-person and third-person views for different gaming experiences.
Realistic Physics: Simulated physics for movement and bullet trajectories.
Particle System: Includes a particle system for explosions and visual effects.
Dynamic Lighting: Utilizes OpenGL lighting for a realistic look.
Controls
W/A/S/D: Move the zeppelin forward, left, backward, and right.
Q/E: Move the zeppelin up and down.
R/F: Rotate the zeppelin left and right.
P: Fire a bullet.
V: Toggle between first-person and third-person views.
Installation
